# LR-SmallFonts
nice and small fonts for Adobe Lightroom (makings going through collection, folder and keyword lists so much easier)

## How to install
Install this file as "TranslatedStrings.txt" into the Lightroom Language Resources directory, e.g.:

Windows:    C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop Lightroom\Resources\en\
Mac OS:     /Applications/Adobe Lightroom.app/Contents/Resources

#####Warning
